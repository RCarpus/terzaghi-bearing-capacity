A Terzaghi bearing capacity calculator built using React and styled with bootstrap. The calculator is live on GitHub Pages: https://rcarpus.github.io/terzaghi-bearing-capacity/.

The Terzaghi Bearing Capacity calculator is a tool used to compute the Terzaghi bearing capacity for a given soil and foundation type. This common calculation used in geotechnical engineering is straightforward to calculate once the design parameters are known, but is prone to calculator errors because of the amount of variables and items to lookup. This tool eliminates those errors and allows for quick and low effort sensitivity analysis.
